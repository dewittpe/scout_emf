# scout_emf
possible extension for scout

## Preliminary work

The `EMF_Scout.py` and `EMF_Scout_Functions.py` files are the original outline
for the needed work to be done.  `EMF_Scout.py.log` is a log file from running
the `EMF_Scout.py` script.

The provided scripts and example data files _do not_ run to completion.
Specifically, running:

    time python EMF_Scout.py > EMF_Scout.py.log

results in:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/pdewitt/opt/anaconda3/envs/scout/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/indexes/base.py", line 3361, in get_loc
        return self._engine.get_loc(casted_key)
      File "pandas/_libs/index.pyx", line 76, in pandas._libs.index.IndexEngine.get_loc
      File "pandas/_libs/index.pyx", line 108, in pandas._libs.index.IndexEngine.get_loc

      File "pandas/_libs/hashtable_class_helper.pxi", line 5206, in pandas._libs.hashtable.PyObjectHashTable.get_item
    KeyError: 'Unnamed: 1'

    The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/pdewitt/scout_emf/EMF_Scout.py", line 1248, in <module>
        df_filter = df[df['Unnamed: 1']=='Final Energy|Buildings|Commercial|Other|Gas']

    KeyError: 'Unnamed: 1'

## Updated work

@dewittpe was provided with the initial files noted above and has started to
refactor the project.

* New modules
  * `import_ecm_results.py` define functions for importing data from the json
      files generated by scout

The file `example_use.py` is a incremental development file showing how to use
the refactored code.

* Data
  * The data set are gzip files in this repo.  You will need to decompress these
      files before running `example_use.py`

## Development Environment

The `environment.yml` file defines a conda environment with the needed modules
and packages for working on scout and this possible emf extension.

    # build the environment
    conda env create -f environment.yml

    # activate the environment
    conda activate scout

    # export an active environment (do this if you add or update packages)
    # __NOTE:__  The following will include a `prefix:` line that should be
    # manually removed from environment.yml
    conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
