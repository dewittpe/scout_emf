Scout is a python package that estimates the impacts of various energy
conservation measures (ECMs) in the U.S. residential and commercial building
sectors. Scout evaluates the energy savings, avoided CO<sub>2</sub> emissions,
operating cost reductions, and cost-effectiveness (using several metrics) of
each ECM under multiple technology adoption scenarios. These results are
obtained for the entire U.S., and also broken out by climate zone, building
class (i.e., new/existing, residential/commercial), and end use.
